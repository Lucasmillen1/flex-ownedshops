This script allows players, jobs, or gangs to own and operate shops within QB-CORE.

**All credits to Flexiboi for the original script, with additional code and fixes implemented by me. Original script can be found here (https://github.com/Flexiboi/flex-ownedshops)**

**Features**

- Players can add items to their shops and set prices!

**Shop Customization:**

- Toggle duty spot
- Access point for buyers (can be targeted or not, with or without a prop)
- Management/buying location

**Compatibility**

- Compatible with both old and new versions of qb-management.

**In config.lua, set Config.Management to 'new' for the new qb-management handled at the bank, or 'old' for older style qb-management.**
