** IF UPDATING PLEASE REPLACE SQL WITH NEW ONE IN RELEASE ** 

This script allows players, jobs, or gangs to own and operate shops within QB-CORE.

**All credits to Flexiboi for the original script, with additional code and fixes implemented by me. Original script can be found here (https://github.com/Flexiboi/flex-ownedshops)**

**Features**

- Players can add items to their shops and set prices!
- Shops need to be purchased if not obtained through a gang or job! (currently only job is tested)
- Businesses can now sell product even if they are on vacation!
- Set your shop to have money deposited into its own bank account or use your society's!

**Shop Customization:**

- Toggle duty spot
- Access point for buyers (can be targeted or not, with or without a prop)
- Management/buying location
- Money Management

**Compatibility**

- Compatible with both old and new versions of qb-management.

**In config.lua, set Config.Management to 'new' for the new qb-management handled at the bank, or 'old' for older style qb-management.**

**Requirements**
- SQL-script
- qb-menu
- qb-target

**Translations**

- This script is available in English, working on more translations! 

**Notes**
- Keep machines NIL until I have a chance to see why so many spawn. Use ped instead.
- Working on adding an option to remove items from shop at anytime
- Working on Email system when someone buys something from your shop
- Working on adding optional Discord logging for all shop activities
- Open to other suggestions! Join the discord!
